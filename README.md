# Python-for-Data-Science
Structured Python practice from fundamentals to core concepts which are required for Data Science.

This repository contains my structured Python practice completed as part of my Data Science learning path.

The notebooks include hands-on implementation of:

- Variables & Data Types
- Operators & Type Casting
- Control Flow (if-else, loops, match-case)
- String Formatting
- Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries
- Functions
- Practice Programs

All notebooks were implemented using JupyterLab with active hands-on practice.

This repository will continue to grow as I progress further IA.
